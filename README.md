# SachinF_Resume

My two fields of interest __1 - Systems Integration__ and __2 - Software Development / Testing__ are split into two different resumes to highlight my experiences in each. 
Though some overlap exists, other aspects are unique. For example my systems integration resume highlight my experiences with hardware and vehicle in the loop testing whereas my software resume mentions my efforts to build a ground up automated test framework.
Enjoy!
